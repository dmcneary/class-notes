# Intro to Networking + 
September 7, 2022

The Internet is a collection of free technologies comprised of applications, built on a variety of protocols, designed to be implemented by a wide range of hardware. Manufacturers are continually coming up with new hardware tech, and the protocols must remain stable in order for all hardware to remain compatible; that being said, just like with networking hardware there are improvements to protocols being developed every day as well.

## History
The US Government realized the need for a networked system many years ago. In the 1970s, the **Defence Advanced Research Project Agency (DARPA)** began working on **ARPANet**. Network protocols began to take their current form around 1977-79, with the design of **packet switching**. As well, research was performed using radio and satellite communication for computer networking.

Information comes in man forms - text, numbers, images, video, audio, etc. **Data communication** involves ways of sending and receiving that information. In general, data communication has 5 components:
- sender
- receiver
- message
- protocol
- transmission medium (cables, wireless, fiber, etc)

**Network protocols** provide the specifications for basic communication:
- Internet Protocol (IP)
- Transmission Control Protocol (TCP)
- User Datagram Protocol (UDP): mainly used for games
- Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP): used for debugging while setting up networks, for utilities, etc.
- address resolution pro

As well, **Application Protocols** utilize the above network protocols to arrange and categorize communication:
- HyperText Transfer Protocol (HTTP)
- Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP)
- File Transfer Protocol (FTP)
- Secure Shell (SSH)

Data flows between two devices can take the form of **simplex** (one way transfer), **half-duplex** (alternating transfer), or **full-duplex** (two-way transfer).

A **network** is defined as the interconnection of a set of communication-capable devices. A network must be performant, reliable, and secure. As well, networks can be of a physical form, or exist as a logical form.

A **physical network** is defined as the set of all hardware, cables, and connecting peripheral devices involves in communication between a set of computing devices. Common examples include Local Area Networks (LAN) and Wide Area Networks (WAN). The major constraints of a physical network system are bandwidth capacity, scalability, and cost. LANs can be as simple as connecting two hosts in a home office. It is generally privately owned, and hosts are identified by unique local addresses. Communication between hosts carries both the source and destination addresses. WANs have a wider geographical span (town, state, country, world) and connects routers, switches, and modems. This is generally how telecommunication companies offer Internet access. There are tiers of WANs which are formed by leasing portions of a high-tier WAN to other lower-tier companies and organizations

A **logical network** is simply a virtualization of a physical network. 

Networks are designed using a number of *topologies*. **Point to point** was the most common for years of the early Internet, in which two computers or nodes were directly connected using a common link. Advantages include:
- High bandwidth, since the line is only shared between two devices
- Low latency, if the devices are close together
- Simplicity and maintainability
However, this topology can only be used over a relatively small area, and the entire network depends on the link.

Another topology which was commonly used is known as the **bus topology** - a single cable with a terminator at each end connected all devices to that single cable. It's very easy to add new nodes, and node failures won't affect other nodes in the network. However, it's difficult to find errors or faults in the system, and damange to the single cable will affect the entire netowrk. As well, this topology is generally congested and slow.

The **ring topology** connects each node to one or two neighboring nodes. Data simply flows between nodes in a cycle, either unidirectionally or bidirectionally. In this topology, there are less packet collisions, and the cost in generally lower. However, it is difficult to add additional nodes, and while the network is more robust compared to the bus, damage to the links at any point has essentially a 50% chance to affect the rest of the nodes on the network.

**Star topologies** connect multiple nodes to a central device called a hub. Contrary to a point to point topology, the hub can have many connections to many other nodes. It is easy to manage, locate failure, and extend the network. It also tends to offer very high speed compared to other topologies. However, failure of a single hub will affect the entire network; redundancy must be utilized to avoid complete network failure.

A **mesh topology** connects all nodes to every other node. Each node transmits its own data as well as the data of other nodes. In this configuration, there can be no single point of failure, and it is easy to identify faults. However, it is difficult to add nodes, since they must be connected to every other node. This is generally an expensive topology which is hard to implement.

## Switching
The Internet is a switched network in which a switch device connects at least two networks together. 

# OOPS need to re-watch slides!!!!
Circuit-switched networks connect switches by a high-capacity link of some sort. It is fairly simple to implement, but is vulnerable to 

### Protocol Layer
protocol defines rules for sender and receiver plus all intermdeditae devidces

protocol is a layered structure and there is *logical communication* between layers. two models: OSI model (educational never used) TCPIP

OSI model is a computational model that standardizes communication without regard to underlying internal struct
1 physical transmission and receptoion of raw data
2 data link link between to nodes
3 network mean of transferring packets
4 transportmeans of transferring variable length data
5 session controls dialog between nodes/hosts
6 presentation establishes context between app layer entities
7 application interaction in the application itself

TCP/IP widely used, exacly the same layer definitions as OSI, but simpler
1 physical
2 data link
3 network
4 transport
5 application

A source and destination is responsible for majority of layers. Network hardware may only be responsible for a physical, or physical + data link layer.
encapsu of layers occurs before packet is sent by the source (or intermediary devices) and descap of layers occurs when packet is received by the destination (or intermediaries).

Multiplexing (source) and demux (dest) can encap a packet from several next-higher layer protocols. For instance, FTP and HTTP protocols can be muxed into a TCP protocol, which can then be muxed into an IP layer alongside a UDP layer.

Any communication between two devices requires two addresses, the source and the destination. Fom the TCP/IP layer perspective, the name of a device is at the application level; the port number specifies the transport layer; a logicaladdress supplies the network layer; and finally, the data link is provided by a physical address

### Standards
A request for comments (RFC) is a publication authored by indivs, eng groups, or comp scis describing a new internet spec. RFCs are numbered sequentially and every new RC is assigned a new number. Later RFCs may render older RFCs as obsolete. Any new network engineer needs to be familiar with the history of landmark RFCs. 

The internet eng task force (IETF) is a large group divided into 10 areas, each with its wown manager. a chairman and the area mgrs constitute the internet eng steering group. These people guide how the internet gets developed.

## Data Link Layer
On the lowest layer of the TCP/IP model, the physical layer consists of all of the actual devices, cables, etc. that make up a network. On top of that, the data link layer provides service to the network layer, and receives service from the physical layer.The Internet itself is a combination of networks glued together by aconnectioning devices. Data link layer consists of two sub layers: the logical link layer provides flow control, acknowledgement, and error detection, whereas media access control specifies who is allowed to access the data/media.

Physical networks and devices have a unique MAC address, which is 48 bits long. MAC addresses are given in hexadecimal and provides frame sync, addressing, and mapping

Frame sync determines start and stop of each fram eusing methods:
- time based detection expects specified amount of time between each frame
- char counting tracks count of remianing chars in frame header
- byte shuffling precedes the frame with special byte sequence such as *DLE STX* or succeeding the frame with *DLE ETX*
- bit shuffling marks start and end of frame with flags consisting of a special pattern
Addressing types include:
- unicast: used to send data over single hop between src and dest, 2nd digit of the first byte must be odd num
- multicast: used to send same data to multiple dests clients in the network; 2nd digit of first byte must be even
- broadcast: used when data must be sent to all devices on the lan; byte must be 0xFF (i.e. FF : FF : FF : FF : FF : FF)
Mapping involves deciding where a message is sent, assigning a connection between an Internet Address (IP) to a hardware address (MAC). Routing decisions can be handled for a packet by a router, using either manual mapping or an Address Resolution Protocol (ARP) which is prev defined to handle the translation.

Ethernet was invented by Xerox in 1976, stdrdized by IEEE in 78, and is still in use today. Most ethernet cable today is known as 10 base T (Twisted Pair), though fibre optic Ethernet now exists at the consumer level for widely separated hubs.
