## Routing between peers: BGP
bgp - border gateway protocol
AS autonomous systems
asn: auto sys num
speaker: router running bgp
peer: -IBGP speakers

An AS is a network and router group controlled by a single admin authority. Companies run ASs which are assigned ID (ASN) numbers by ICANN - every AS controls a set of IP addresses. ASNs can be either 16 or 32 bits

There are many routing protocols; BGP was established in jan 1989 in AUS, released in june 89, versions up through revised v4 released up to 1995.

BGP relies on distributing tables/databases of routes and speakers and updating them among peers as necessary.
