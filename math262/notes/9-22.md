## Orthogonal Projection in 2-D

If we imagine a line L in R^2 through (0,0), and have a vector x in R^2 as well, then we can think of x as the unique sum of two projections: projection onto L parallel of x, and projection onto L perpendicular of x.

The transformation T such that T(vec x) = x parallel is called the orthogonal projection of R^2 onto L:
proj_L(\vec{x}) = \vec{x}^parallel

### Formula
Given:
- Line L
- Vector x
- Vector w in same direction as L
- vector x parallel = k\vec{w} for some scalar k
- \vec{x}perp = \vec{x} - \vec{x}para = \vec{x} - k\vec{w}
- \vec{w}\cdot\vec{x}^\para = 0

Then:
0 = \vec{w}\cdot (\fec{x}para - k\vec{w}) \\
0 = \vec{w}\cdot\vec{x} - k\vec{w}\cdot\vec{w} \\
k = \frac{\vec{w}\cdot\vec{x}}{\vec{w}\cdot\vec{w}}
