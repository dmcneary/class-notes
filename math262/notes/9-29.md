# Invertible Linear Transformations
September 29, 2021

Inverse operations work similarly to exponents and logarithms:

A transformation $T$ from $\Reals^m$ into $\Reals^n$ is said to be invertible if, for each vector $\vec{y}$ in $\Reals^n$  there exists one and only one vector $\vec{y}$ in $\Reals^m$ such that $T(\vec{x}) = \vec{y}$.

Similar to function inverses, as we can invert a function if $f(x) = y$ for any unique $y$.

The inverse of an invertible transformation $T$ is the transformation that assigns a unique $\vec{x}$ in $\Reals^m$ to a $\vec{y}$ in $\Reals^n$ such that $T(\vec{x}) = \vec{y}$. Thus, $T^{-1}(T(\vec{x})) = \vec{x}$. As well, the inverse of the inverse of a linear transformation is the original linear transformation. 

## Properties of invertible matrices
A is a square matrix of size n x n, and b is a vector in R^n
A is invertible if:
- system A\vecx = \vec b has a unique solution
- A homogeneous system Ax = 0 has a unique solution
A is not invertible if:
- Ax = b has no solutions or infinite solutions
- - rank A < n

Thus, if A and B are both n x m matrices and AB = BA = I_n, then the following are equivalent expressions:
- BA = I_n
- AB = I_n
- A and B are both invertible
- A^-1 = B and B^-1 = A

If only BA = I_n, then then system A\vec{x} = \vec{0}
