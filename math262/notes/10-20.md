## Properties of similar matrices
The relation terminology "is similar to" between n x n matrices satisfies the following:
- reflexive: A is similar to A
  - AI = IA
- symmetric: A is similar to B <=> B is similar to A
  - AS <=> SB <=> S^-1AS = B <=> S^-1A = BS^-1 <=> BR = RA, R = S^-1
- transitive: A is similar to B & B is similar to C => A is similar to C
  - AS = SB and BR = RC => A(SR) = (AS)R = (SB)R = S(BR) = (SR)C (if R and S are invertible, so is SR: (SR)^-1 = R^-1 * S^-1)
