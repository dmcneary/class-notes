## Review

A system of linear equations can either be consistent (either one or infinite solutions) or inconsistent (no solutions).

Elementary operations on systems of equations preserve the solutions while manipulating the equations to be easier to work with:
- Multiplication of equation *E* by a non-zero number (*E* &larr; *aE, a* &ne; 0)
- Addition to *E* of another equation *E'* (*E* &larr; *E + E'*)
- Exchanging two equations *E* and *E'* (*E &harr; E'*)

Systems can be simplified into matrices (sing. matrix), and we can develop an algebra to work with these matrices in solving systems of linear equations.
