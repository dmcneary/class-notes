# Image and Kernel of Linear Transformations
October 6, 2021

## Domain and range
Remember, the domain and target (range) are befined by input and output. A linear transformation T from Rm to Rn is denoted by T: Rm -> Rn. The linear space Rm is called the domain of T and the linear space Rn is called the target of T.

## Image of a transformation
The image is simply where the transformation leads to: the image of T : Rn -> Rm is the set of vectors b for Rn for which the equation T(x) = b has a solution. For T(x) = Ax = B, the image of A is the set of all vectors b in Rm for which the system Ax = b is consistent. Images are denoted using **im**()

### Examples
Let T : R2 -> R3 be the orthogonal projection of R3 onto the plane x_3 = 0. The image of this transformation would be any vector which lies in the plane : im(T) = { x_3 = 0}

Let T : R2 -> R3 is the transformation given by matrix A = [1 2][2 4][3 6]:

vec b = A vecx = [1 2][2 4][3 6] times [x1 x2] = x1[1 2 3] + x2[2 4 6] = x1[123] + 2x2[123] = (x1 + 2x2)[1 2 3]

Thus, the image of A is all of the vectos which have the form {(x1 + 2x2)[1 2 3]}

x1 + 2x2 is just a scalar here, so we can write k[1 2 3]

So, the solution b is any vector with direction [1 2 3] which goes through [0 0 0].
