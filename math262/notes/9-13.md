## Relation Between Number of Solutions and the Rank of a Matrix

**Review:** In a rref:
- Every entry above and below a leading 1 must be 0
- Every entry to the left of a leading 1 must be 0
  
In the simplest system, consisting of 1 equation with one unknown variable (ax = b), we have three possibilities:
1. a &ne; 0: exactly one solution (x = b/a)
2. a = 0, b = 0: infinitely many solutions (0x = 0)
3. a = 0, b &ne; 0: no solutions (0 &ne; 1)

A system with one or more solutions is known as consistent. A system with no solutions is called inconsistent.

The reduced row-echelon form of augmented matrices A, B, C of three linear systems are given. How many solutions are there in each case?

$rref(A) = \begin{bmatrix}
1 & 0 & 2 & 0 \\
0 & 1 & 0 & 0 \\
0 & 0 & 0 & 1
\end{bmatrix}$
No solution due to row 3: 0x + 0y + 0z = 1 (inconsistent)

$rref(B) = \begin{bmatrix}
1 & 2 & 0 & 3 \\
0 & 0 & 1 & 5 \\
0 & 0 & 0 & 0
\end{bmatrix}$
Infinite solutions due to free variable in row 1: x = 3 -2t, z = 5, y = t

$rref(C) = \begin{bmatrix}
1 & 0  & 0 & 3 \\
0 & 1 & 0 & 5 \\
0 & 0 & 1 & 7
\end{bmatrix}$
One solution: x = 3, y = 5, z = 7

A linear system is inconsistent if and only if the reduced row-echelon form of its augmented matrix contains the row [0, 0, ..., 0, 1].

### Rank of a matrix
The rank of a matrix A is the number of leading 1's in the reduced row-echelon form rref(A). It is denoted by rank(A).

Suppose A is the matrix of a system with n equations and m unknowns:
1. rank(A) &le; n and rank(A) &le; m: this is because every row and every column contain at most a single leading 1.
2. If the system is inconsistent, then rank(A) &lt; n
3. If the system has exactly one solution, then rank(A) = m
4. If the system has infinitely many solutions, then rank(A) &lt; m

If a linear system has exactly one solution, then there must be at least as many equations as there are variables: m &le; n

A linear system with fewer equations than unknowns (n &lt; m) is either inconsistent or has infinitely many solutions.

The rank of a matrix will *always* be less than or equal to both m and n.
