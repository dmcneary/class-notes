# AVL Trees
October 27, 2021

Binary Search Trees have an optimal behavior for search/insert/delete of O(log n) for a balanced tree. In the worst case, the tree behaves like a linked list and search/insert/delete takes O(n) time. For degenerate behavior to be avoided, the balance of the tree must be maintained over all insertions and deletions.

## Balanced trees
Balanced binary trees include: 
- AVL trees
- Red-Black trees

Balanced N-ary trees include:
- B-trees
- B+-trees

### AVL trees
A BST is not necessarily always balanced. AVL trees were discovered by two Russian maths in 1962: If T is a non-empty BST, then T is an AVL if and only if it's left and right subtrees are AVL trees and | left height - right height | <= 1. Or, in English, an AVL tree is a tree which is balanced, but not necessarily complete or full. By maintaining this balance, we can sustain the O(log n) behavior.

Balance factors can be defined as the level of balance that a node contributes. AVL aims for values of -1, 0, or 1. This property is added to the Node class of a tree to keep track of the balance of the overall tree.

Rotation can easily maintain balance in a tree in an O(1) operation.
