# Graph Traversal
November 24, 2021

Two majorly popular algorithms exist for traversal: depth first search and breadth first search.

DFS traverses as deep as possible down one path before backtracking and traversing the next path. BFS visits all neighboring nodes, then their neighbors, and so on until the entire graph has been visited. DFS is commonly implemented using recursion, whereas BFS usually uses an iterative approach.

BFS: Time complexity is O(V + E).
DFS: Time complexity is O(V + E).

BFS finds the shortest path from s to each vertex; it is not the most efficient (Djikstra's Algorithm is more commonly used) but will get the job done.

DFS effectively constructs narrow and long trees, with the starting vertex as the root. On the other hand, BFS constructs a wide and short tree.
