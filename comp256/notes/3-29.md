# Refresher: Permutations and Combinations
March 29, 2022

Both combinations and permutations are ways of counting elements of a set. However, when a specific order matters, or when similar elements can be counted as one, we must be able to know which counting method to use.

## Example 1
a. There are 6 boys who enter a boat with 8 seats, 4 on each side. How many ways can they set in the boat?

This is a permutation of $P(8,6)$:

$$
\begin{aligned}
P(8, 6) &= \frac{8!}{(8-6)!} \\
&= \frac{8!}{2!} \\
&= 8\cdot7\cdot6\cdot5\cdot4\cdot3 \\
&= 20160
\end{aligned}
$$

b. Of the 6 boys, 2 of them are known as A and B, and there is another boy W. How many seating arrangements are possible with A and B on one side and W on the other?

This is a product of three symmetric permutations - $2[P(4, 2) \cdot P(4, 1) \cdot P(5, 3)]$:

$$
\begin{aligned}
2[P(4, 2) \cdot P(4, 1) \cdot P(5, 3)] &= 2(\frac{4!}{(4-2)!}\cdot\frac{4!}{(4-1)!}\cdot\frac{5!}{(5-3)!}) \\ 
&=2(\frac{4!}{2!}\cdot\frac{4!}{3!}\cdot\frac{5!}{2!}) \\
&=2(4\cdot3\cdot4\cdot5\cdot4\cdot3) \\
&= 5760
\end{aligned}
$$
## Example 2
Consider a committee of 5 people, to be selected from a group of 6 men and 4 women.

a. How many committees of 3 men and 2 women are possible?

This is a combination of $C(6, 3)\cdot C(4, 2)$:

$$
\begin{aligned}
C(6, 3) \cdot C(4, 2) &= \frac{6!}{(6-3)!3!} \cdot \frac{4!}{(4-2)!2!} \\
&= \frac{6!}{3!3!} \cdot \frac{4!}{2!2!} \\
&= \frac{6\cdot 5\cdot 4}{3\cdot 2\cdot 1} \cdot \frac{4\cdot 3}{2\cdot 1} \\
&= \frac{120}{6} \cdot \frac{12}{2} \\
&= 120
\end{aligned}
$$
b. How many all-male committees?

This is a combination of $C(6,5)$:

$$
\begin{aligned}
C(6,5) &= \frac{6!}{(6-5)!5!} \\
&= \frac{6}{1!} \\
&= 6
\end{aligned}
$$

c. How many committees with a majority of women?

This is a combination of $C(4, 3)\cdot C(6, 2) + C(4, 4) \cdot C(6, 1)$:

$$
\begin{aligned}
C(4, 3) \cdot C(6, 2)+C(4, 4) \cdot C(6, 1) &= \frac{4!}{(4-3)!3!} \cdot \frac{6!}{(6-2)!2!} +\frac{4!}{(4-4)!4!} \cdot \frac{6!}{(6-1)!1!} \\
&= \frac{4!}{1!3!} \cdot \frac{6!}{4!2!} + \frac{4!}{0!4!} \cdot \frac{6!}{5!1!} \\
&= 4\cdot \frac{6\cdot 5}{2\cdot 1} + 1\cdot 6 \\
&= 4\cdot15 + 6 \\
&= 66
\end{aligned}
$$


## Example 3
From the digits 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, how many numbers are greater than 4000?

a. with repeated digits allowed:

$$
3\cdot 5\cdot 5\cdot 5 = 3\cdot 5^3 = 3\cdot 125 = 375
$$
