#### To Review (Quiz #3 on March 17):
Inductive proofs must consist of a base case, an inductive hypothesis with an assumed truth, and an inductive proof which utilizes the hypothesis.

Contrapositive proofs take the inverse to make the proof - for example, in attempting to prove $p \rightarrow q$, we can utilize the contrapositive, which is $\lnot q \rightarrow \lnot p$

Contradictory proofs negate the antecedent of the conditional and prove that there is a logical contradiction in proving that the assumption is true.

## The Sum & Product Rules

If there are $n_1$ ways to to some task, and $n_2$ ways to do another task, then we can calculate the number of ways to perform both tasks as  $n_1n_2$ ($n_1$ and $n_2$)
- In other words, we are taking all of the ways to do $n_1$ choosing 1 way, and $n_2$ choosing 1 way. The notation for this can also be written as $\begin{pmatrix}n_1  \\ 1 \end{pmatrix}\begin{pmatrix}n_2  \\ 1 \end{pmatrix}$, read as "$n_i$ choose 1" 

Similarly, using the same terms, we can calculate the total number of ways to perform $n_1$ ***OR*** $n_2$ by summing them together as $n_1 + n_2$.
