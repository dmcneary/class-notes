# Swift cont.

There are two major topics that we have to cover in order for assignment #3 to make sense: algebraic data types and generics.

## Algebraic data types
This concept can be similar to enums and switch blocks in other languages, but they are different enough that they require their own explanation.

An algebraic data type in abstract terms is a mechanism for defining a type as something, OR as something else. For instance, a Boolean is either true or false. They are not restricted to binary situations, and multiple OR conditions can be strung together. Algebraic types also use constructors, but they are not fully programmable as OOP constructors are. The specific result of how the type is assigned is depended on pattern-matching at runtime. This is generally implemented using a switch.

In our recurring example of an immutable linked list, a switch can be used in a function to return something depending on whether an `input` is a `Cons` or a `Nil` object. This makes writing methods a very simple, one-definition-and-done process.

Algebraic data types are introduced in Swift using the `enum` keyword. A type definition is enclosed in braces following the type name, with cases outlined with their different possibilities as constructors and parameters. From there, new variable declarations can be written using the type name and a dot syntax to reference the variation.
