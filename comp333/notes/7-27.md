# Higher-Order Functions Wrap-Up + Midterm Review
July 27, 2022

To recap last class session, we covered list routines provided by higher-order functions in JS (in this context, list is used to describe JS arrays). 

## HoF Review Worksheet

1. Extract all the elements which are even (hint: use filter)

``` javascript
const filteredArr = arr.filter(el => el % 2 === 0);
```

2. Produce a new array, where each element is the result of a corresponding element in arr + 7 (hint: use map)

``` javascript
const mappedArr = arr.map(el => el + 7);
```

3. Produce the smallest element in arr. You may assume that no element is greater than 0 (hint: use reduce)

``` javascript
const sm0lElement = arr.reduce((prev, curr) => (curr < prev) ? curr : prev);
```

4. Find the sum of all the odd elements in arr. The sum of an empty array is 0. (hint: use filter and reduce)
``` javascript
const oddsSum = arr.filter(el => el % 2 > 0).reduce((prev, curr) => curr + prev, 0);
```
