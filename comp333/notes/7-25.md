# Higher-order Functions
July 25, 2022

Last session, we started to write some JS code and got side-tracked by variable scope.

```
function printArr(arr) {
	for (let index = 0; index < arr.length; index++) {
		let element = arr[index];
		console.log(element);
	}
}
```

This simple function prints every element in an array. What if we wanted to print all elements which are greater thn or less than a certain value? How about all We would need to define a lot of slightly different  `print` functions in order to cover all possible conditional situations. What if it was possible to define a function which parameterizes these different `print` functions? This can definitely be implemented using virtual dispatch in languages like Java, but JavaScript makes the process much less verbose by using a feature called **higher-order functions**. Functions are able to take other functions as a parameter/argument, and the passed function is treated as data used in the body of the caller.

As of 2015, there are a number of built-in higher-order functions which makes iterating an operation over an array very simple.
