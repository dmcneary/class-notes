# Functional/immutable lists: representation and operations
July 18, 2022

*( first part of class was spent on virtual dispatch exercises )*

In some languages (such as Scala), values or variables declared are immutable by default. For instance, two Linked Lists concatenated together will return a whole new list, without modifying either original list. This is a hallmark of functional and logical programming. In a mathematical sense, this makes more sense; the result of a function or expression should not change when the same information is used.

How is this idea implemented? A "normal" mutable linked list, as defined in Java for example, is not too far off from an immutable definition.
