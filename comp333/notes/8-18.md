# Generics
August 18, 2022

Generics are a concept that allows us to use multiple different types in a single declaration. For instance, examine the following code:
```swift
indirect enum IntList {
	case Cons(Int, IntList)
	case Nil
}

let list: IntList = IntList.Cons(1, IntList.Cons(2, IntList.Cons(3, IntList.Nil)));

func length(_ input: IntList) -> Int {
	switch input {
		case .Cons(_, let tail):
			return 1 + length(tail);
		case .Nil:
			return 0;
	}
}
```

What if we wanted a `StringList`? We cannot simply enter strings in our `IntList` constructor - this will not compile. We could declare a separate `StringList` enum type, but that isn't very concise and involves a lot of repeated code. As well, any functions involving the enumerated type must be repeated.

Enter generics! 
```swift
indirect enum List<A> {
	case Cons(A, List<A>)
	case Nil
}

let list1: List<Int> = List.Cons(1, List.Cons(2, List.Cons(3, List.Nil)));
let list2: List<String> = List.Cons("foo", List.Cons("bar", List.Nil));
```

There is a concept called **parametric polymorphism** which is often confused with generics. Generics involve type variables on data structures, whereas PP involve type variables on functions/methods. Note this also gives us another use of the word *polymorphism*!

We can revise our `length` function to work with our new generic type `List`.
```swift
func length<A>(_ input: List<A>) -> Int {
	switch input {
		case .Cons(_, let tail):
			return 1 + length(tail);
		case .Nil:
			return 0;
	}
}
print(length(list1)); //3
print(length(list2)); //2
```

Specifically in functional programming, generics are fairly common (relative to OOP languages like Java).

## Tuples
Swift has support for tuples, which are sequences of data which do not necessarily contain the same type. 

## Extensions
Extensions are a way to retroactively add a method to an existing type. for example, we can add an `add` method to the Int type:
```swift
extension Int {
	func add(_ other: Int) -> Int {
		return self + other;
	}
}
print(5.add(4)); //9
```
