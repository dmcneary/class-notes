## Contents of the PCB
The PCD as a data structure contains lots of info, including the state of the CPU, state of the process itself, memory location, scheduling and accounting info, open files and other resources, and parents + children. Only some of these fields are dynamic - that is, some data about a process may not be changed over the lifecycle of the process (such as a parent).

PCBs can be stored in an array of memory addresses
