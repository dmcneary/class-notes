## Estimating total CPU time for batch processes
Total CPU time can be considered two different ways based on the context. In long-term scheduling, the difference between the creation of the process and its destruction is considered total CPU time. This is either provided by the programmer based on test results/calculations, or can be estimated by measuring the duration of previous runs of the process. In short-term scheduling, the total CPU time is not consistent. It may differ between each arrival and departure period. It can, however, be estimated using prior execution data. It is most commonly averaged exponentially, combining the last estimate of the total CPU time with the last observed duration, to provide the estimated duration of the next total CPU time for that process:

$$
S_{n+1} = \alpha T_n + (1- \alpha )S_n
$$

...where $S_{n+1}$ is the next total CPU time, $S_n$ is the last *estimated* observed time, and $T_n$ is the last observed actual CPU time. $\alpha$ is a variable of relative weight of $T_n$ vs. $S_n$. A high relative weight value adapts quickly to changes in behavior of observed values, but also strongly regards outliers which may create noisy data. A lower alpha value will disregard extreme outliers but will contour predictions more slowly when changes occur.

## Batch Algorithm Performance
Completing the maximum number of processes in a given period of time is always the main goal of a batch algorithm. The difference in processing order between the previously discusses algorithms cannot reduce the total CPU times of the processes, but careful choice in the algorithm used can reduce the waiting times between them.

The **turnaround time** is the sum of total CPU time and waiting time for a process. The **average turnaround time (ATT)* for a set of processes is the mean value of turnaround for each individual process.

The fairness of the algorithm must also be considered to avoid one process greedily occupying the CPU, or neglecting other processes for too long. **Starvation** is the term used to describe when a process has been indefinitely postponed while others are able to access the CPU. Both SJF and SRT can experience starvation scenarios.

## Scheduling Interactive Processes
An interactive process needs some sort of communication in order to complete its task - usually a form of user input. It responds by generating output to some device. The primary goal in interactive process scheduling is to respond to inpout in a timely manner, while allowing the CPU to be accessed by other processes according to time-sharing protocol.

A **time quantum** is a slice of time which any given process is allowed to access the CPU. A **round-robin (RR)** algorithm uses a single queue of processes where the priority is determined solely by the index of the process in the queue. When its quanta runs out, it is moved to the back of the queue and the next process in line is allowed its time at the CPU.
