## Estimating total CPU time

## Scheduling Interactive Processes
An interactive process needs some sort of communication in order to complete its task - usually a form of user input. It responds by generating output to some device. The primary goal in interactive process scheduling is to respond to inpout in a timely manner, while allowing the CPU to be accessed by other processes according to time-sharing protocol.

A **time quantum** is a slice of time which any given process is allowed to access the CPU. A **round-robin** algorithm uses a single queue of processes where the priority is determined solely by the index of the process in the queue. When its quanta runs out, it is moved to the back of the queue and the next process in line is allowed its time at the CPU.
