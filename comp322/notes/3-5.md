# Detecting Deadlocks
March 5, 2022

## Graph Reduction
If there is a cycle in a resource allocation graph between two more more processes and resources, then a deadlock is certain to occur as each process blocks each other. However, for more complex graphs, this is not always so apparent. A graph reduction algorithm may be employed in order to detect a deadlock more efficiently:
```
while (unblocked_process p in graph) {
    select unblocked_process p;
    remove p; //including all edges connected to p
}
```
A graph is **completely reducible** if the completed algorithm results in a blank graph. From this, we can theorize that:
1. A state is in a deadlock state if and only if the resource graph for that state is not completely reducible.
2. All permutations of reduction sequences of a given resource allocation graph end with the same final graph result.
Given these theories, any sequence of reductions can determine whether or not a resource graph represents a deadlock state.
