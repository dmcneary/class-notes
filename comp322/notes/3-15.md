# Memory Management
March 15, 2022

A hardware device which is able to store data is called memory. Data is stored in physical memory in fixed-size units called **words**. Random-access memory (RAM) is one common instance of memory, also known as physical memory.

## Logical (Virtual) Memory
A physical address is an integer which identifies a word in the physical memory. This may be virtualized as a logical address, which references a logical address space mapped to a portion of the physical memory. This is needed because the starting address of a program in physical memory is not known: memory is used more efficiently when a program is allowed to allocate sequentially, but this is not easy (or always feasible) to perform in physical memory. Thus, an abstraction is required for efficient memory management.
