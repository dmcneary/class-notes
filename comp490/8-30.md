Intro points:
- UC students and CC students are allocated $14k per student from tax dollars
- CSUN students are allocated $10k
- Tenure prevents what happened to Galileo (excommunicated, locked away)
- Tuition is about 50% of other universities
- As a result, CSUN cannot afford to offer adequate numbers of class sections - oops!
- Tenure-track professors could teach additional sections, but that takes jobs away from part-time lecturers, and the union doesn't like that - oops!
