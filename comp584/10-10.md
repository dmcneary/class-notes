# CSS Flexbox

There are three characteristsics of responsive design:
- Media Queries
	- Browser reports screen resolution
	- Based on current width, apply specific CSS rules
- Images that resize
	- Images should scale based on resolution
- Flexible grid-based layouts

Before flexbox was developed, web design and layouts were sort of hacky. Tables were used non-semantically to provide a crude grid for laying out elements, followed by "floats" which were developed to be used only for images. Thus, flexbox is the first dedicated layout tool for CSS.

Flexbox contains child flex-items inside a parent flex-container. Using CSS rules, it is very easy to use columnar & row designs, and adjust vertical heights and alignments just as we can using tables. The flex-container has two axes, the main axis and the cross axis, along which the flex-items are laid out. The direction of the main axis is specified by CSS rules (horizontal by default).

In the short history of Flexbox, the `display` properties which activate the feature has changed a few times. Currently, `display: flex;` is widely supported though prefixing/polyfills may need to be written to target compatibility for older browsers.
