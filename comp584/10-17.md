# CSS Grid
October 17, 2022

Grid was written into the CSS3 specification following Flexbox. It works in two dimensions, and is recommended for use with the major components of the layout (whereas Flexbox is typically used for UI elements). With Flexbox, row containers have nothing to do with other rows. On the other hand, Grib allows a `div` container to span multiple rows and/or columns.
