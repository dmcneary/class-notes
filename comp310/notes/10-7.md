What is a grammar?
a grammar is a 4-tuple (V, T, S, P) where:
V is a finite set of variables
T is a finite set of terminal symbols
S is a start variable/symbol, such that S is an element of V
P is a finite set of productions, each with the form of w_1 -> w_2 where w_1 is an element of (V union T)\*V(V union T)\* and w_2 is an element of (V union T ) \*

Grammar is presented as a list of rules, such that rules are written with a single arrow and their applications are described using a double arrow.
