# Characteristics of Jazz
February 2, 2022

Jazz is a combination of influences. African Americans contributed immensely with traditions of blues, spirituals, and work songs. The rhythms and improvisations of these styles, along with tonality and phrasing, are categorically African. Western European music contributed a sort of framework, providing instrumentation, form, harmony concepts, and polyphony.

Jazz typically has a set of characteristics:
1. Improvisation - the ability to compose and perform at the ssame time. It is an essential element of jazz solos, where melody is still important but ornaments or embellishments are equally important.
2. Rhythm - The swing associated with jazz is unique - however, not all jazz styles swing. Syncopation is inherent in a swing.
3. Distinctive voices - players develop their own style and repertoire
4. Melody - Blue notes and inflections (bending, vibrato, ghost notes, fake tones, growls)
5. Spontaneity - Arrangements of form and harmony are given, but most of what is played is not written down
