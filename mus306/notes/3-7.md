# Musicians of the Swing Era
March 7, 2022

Just as Flecther Henderson's band became the ideal arrangement for big bands, Coleman Hawkins became the model saxophonist for the era.

## Coleman Hawkins (1904-1969) (tenor sax)
Involved in Fletcher Henderson's big band, he was the dominating force in influencing sax style (though Lester Young's style became influential as well). Going by nicknames of "Hawk" and "Bean," he recorded his first solo on the song "Mean Blues" with Mammie Smith's Jazz Hounds. He joined Henderson and his group in 1923 and stayed until 1934. He then left the States due to racial relations, and toured Europe until the first outbreaks of WW2. 

When he came back, he had already started with a big band but became more well known for his smaller group arrangements. His recording of "Body and Soul" became one of his hits, which barely featured any horns, as well as a very limited melody before launching into a solo. He also recorded a version of "The Man I Love" in a similar fashion, briefly mentioning the melody before soloing.
