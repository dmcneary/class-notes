## Beginnings of Jazz
Jazz really started taking off during the Roaring 20's - however, it is commonly thought to have originated in the late 19th century in New Orleans, LA. Four different styles of music are considered the "roots" of jazz:
- Concert/marching band
- Ragtime
- Blues
- Gospel

### Blues
Blues music is the root of almost every music which currently exists in America - it is the fundamental tonality of many genres. "Blue notes" are one of the factors of blues which are considered foundational to the devlopment of jazz. WC Handy created the term to describe rhythmic or tonal variations on a note (whereas Western symphonic music would be very rigid on timing and tonal quality of each note)
