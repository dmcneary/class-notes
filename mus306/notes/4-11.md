## What is Cool Jazz?
In a very general sense, "cool" players were west-coast white people, so much that the genre is often referred to as "West Coast Jazz." On the other hand, "East Coast Jazz" usually refers to hard-bop.

Many "cool" players came to Los Angeles by way of big bands and touring, and as the big band swing era died out on the 40's they stayed to pursue recording careers in TV and film. Commericial music became the bread and butter for these musicians, whereas jazz became a part-time distraction.

Characteristics of cool jazz include odd time signatures, such as 3/4 and 5/4, as well as "softer" instrumentation with flugelhorns, French horns, oboes, and more. There is more emphasis on written arrangements and counterpoint, but solos can still be very harmonically complex (though a bit less aggressive). Bop would have the melody in unison at the beginning and end of the tune with solos in the middle, where "cool" would incorporate more of an Ellington or even Morton style (short improvised solos woven into the arrangement).

## Claude Thornehill
Thornehill gets credit as the "father of the cool big band," experimenting with gentler sound and influenced a lot of musicians, including the crew hanging out with Gil Evans. Evans also arranged music for Thornehill's band. "Snowfall" is Thornehill's signature song.

3 albums to remember from this era are "Sketches of Spain," "Miles Ahead," and "Porgy and Bess."
