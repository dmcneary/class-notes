## Relationships
Objects must be able to communicate in order to accomplish tasks. Different types of relationships include (in order of weakest to strongest):

- works-with / depends-on
- has-a
- implements-a
- is-a

The cardinality (one-to-one, one-to-many, etc) is depicted through special labels on the ends of the relationship connectors connecting classes together.

### Dependencies
When one object *might* relies on another to accomplish its assigned task, this creates a dependency. Implementation of a dependency occurs when a class attribute or method is a parameter or local variable of another class. For instance, in an e-commerce application, a Cart object might depend on a Product class when an add(Product item) method is called.

### Association
Stronger than a dependency relationship, an association occurs when an object *will* contain references to another object or its properties.
