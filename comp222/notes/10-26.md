# Multithreading
October 26, 2021

Multithreading is implemented in the instruction control unit. However, the operating system commonly is the manager of multiple threads. Temporal MT is sequential, and comes in coarse-grained or fine-grained (also known as interleaved) flavors. Only one thread at a time is active, with other threads in standby. Coarse-grained implementations commonly wait for a stall via a cache miss, TLD miss, or other halt to switch to another standby thread. Interleaved MT distributes threads to each stage of the pipeline; this is also known as time-sharing.

Superscalar is the ability to perform multiple integer operations at the same time; execution units are duplicated completely and each EU has its own ICU (or at least, its own pipeline). Thus, multiple instructions can run per clock cycle via simultaneous multi-threading (SMT). Almost all of AMD's processors use SMT to run faster, whereas Intel only use SMT in 1/3 of their processors.

Intel's implementation of SMT is called Hyperthreading. This proprietary style of MT adds a scheduler that makes each core appear to be two logical cores, thus effectively doubling the number of cores in a machine.
