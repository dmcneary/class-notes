# ARM cont.

Will be going over VAX/MIX and x86 next week, still mostly focusing on Chp. 2

## Early Computer Tech
- R/TL: Resistance/Transistor logic - usually each board would serve one function (ALU on a 8x8 board, for example) with transistors as long as 12mm
- MSI/LSI: Medium scale/Large scale integration - first DRAMs, more transistors but still not super precise, so could be assembled by hand. Realization of "system on a board"
- VLSI: Very large scale integration - emergence of System on a Chip

## ARMv7
ARM stands for 
ARM and MIPS are very similar in some ways: they were both announced in 1985, both 32 bit instructions, both word aligned (least significant hex digit of a hex instruction must be 0, 4, 8, or C). However, MIPS has 3 addressing modes, while ARM has 9.

ARM does have some unique instructions, primarily dealing with memory manipulation.

The first ARM designs were for low power, low clock freq for portable devices. However, Apple has spearheaded the development of ARM architecture for higher power computing.
