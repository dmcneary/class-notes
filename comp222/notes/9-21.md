# ARM and Systems on Chips (SoC)
September 21, 2021

## Quiz #2 Review
- CPU Execution Unit contains ALU + ICU + registers

- A CPU core contains EU + L1 caches

- SoC can contain any of these: GPU, CPU, FPU

- MIPS32 ISA contains Integer and FPU primitives + psuedo ops

- A MIPS CPU may contain an Integer unit + up to 4 co procs, CP0 + CP1(FPU)

- MIPS CP0 contains BadVA, Status, Case + EPC registers

- CP1 contains $f0-$f31 registers

- MIPS CP2 is not defined

- MIPS FPU is also called CP1

- MIPS FPU does not have an addi instruction (integer instruction)

- MIPS "load" insstructions can read data from .heap, .data, or .stack (any memory segment)

- MIPS "store" ins first writes data via a "write buffer" directly into L1 d-cache

- MIPS32 "Load immediate" (li) and "load address" (la) ins are pseudo instructions

- MIPS32 lw, lh, lhu, lb, lbu ins are primitive instructions

- In MIPS32, execution of the following results in data being stored into the heap:
```
li $t2, 0x100400a
sb $t1, ($t2)
```
