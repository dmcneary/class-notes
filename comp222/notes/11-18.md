# Parallelism: Instruction-level and Data-level
November 18, 2021

Multi-threading is one way that we can achieve faster processing speed without increasing the clock speed (and thus, the power requirement and heat output) of the CPU. However, we can also implement parallelism in hardware by designing processor cores with multiple instruction and data input streams.
