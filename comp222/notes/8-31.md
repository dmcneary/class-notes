Review History of Technology on class website

MARS - MIPS Assembler and Runtime Simulator

3 basic architectures
- MIPS + RISC V
- ARM - widely used for System on Chip (SoC) in Apple and Tesla products
- x86 - legacy chips widely used in computers 

First half of term will be mainly a deep dive into COMP122 topics, second half will deal with multi-core and parallel topics.

No programming in this class! Homework will be quizzes in Canvas, plus midterm and final exams and projects (1 research, 1 simulation)

ISA - Instruction set architecture
- Program Control
- System Control
- I/o
- Memory mapping

Project 1 - Research paper on multi-threading

Computer Organization is a study of the basic components which execute instructions - ALUs, ICUs, Registers, etc.
