## Miscellaneous notes
RISC is all about single-cycle execution - therefore, data can only be moved from registers to memory (or register to register, of course), using LOAD and STORE. CISC doesn't care about spending clock cycles and allows for memory to memory MOV commands (takes 15 clock cycles!)

**IPC**: instructions per clock
**SMT**: Simultaneous multi-threading

**CLA**: Carry look-ahead units

The CPU integer execution unit (**EU**) will perform more than just simple arithmatic

MIPS arch accepts up to 4 co-processors, one of which is a FPU. Dedicated registers vs. general registers is a key difference between RISC and CISC

Carry and overflow bits are only updated during arithmetic operations

The Program Counter in MIPS/ARMv5 is stored in PC/R15

The only registers in MIPS/ARMv7 which cannot be written are $0/R31

Any RISC CPU must contain an on-chip memory of L1 I-cache and L1 D-cache

In general when a CPU uses virtual memory addressing, it uses a MMU with TLB to determine the physical address

The simplest to implement cache mapping is direct mapped

To call a subroutine, MIPS uses jump and link (jal), ARM uses branch and link (bl)

For system calls, MIPS uses syscall, ARMv5 uses swi (software interrupt)

## News
Tesla has their own embedded chip and their own supercomputer (Dojo SC). It's water-cooled and capable of 7000 watts (nVidia's datacenter GPU runs at 500w).
