# Stack Machines, Registers, and Clocks
October 14, 2021

Stack machines are on-chip implementations of stacks. We will look at how they are constructed, along with registers and clocks.

A stack machine is a processor or VM in which the primary interaction is moving temp vals to and from a push/pop stack. The use of hardware stacks significantly reduce the need to use registers.
