# Textbook Notes - Chapter 2

## 2.1 - Introduction

The linguistics of computations are slightly different from human language. We can program in high-level programming lnaguages like Java or C++, which are compiled down to Assembly...which can further be "assembled" into machine language.

Machine language (and different flavors of Assembly) consists of instructions, and a vocabulary of instructions forms an instruction set.

The textbook chooses to focus on MIPS, which has displayed elegance since the 1980s. Other dialects, like ARM and x86, are very similar in their syntax to MIPS, with their individual idiosyncracies.

This similarity results from nearly universal core principals that govern hardware technology and design. This is no coincidence - simplicity at the minimization of cost and maximization of performance has always been the common goal of computer designers.

The *stored-program concept* is central to the modern era of computing - the idea that instructions and data can be represented and stored as numbers.
