# The Wheel:  UX processes,  lifecycles, methods,  and techniques

## Introduction

Interaction describes the wide variety of communication and collaboration between a human and some artifact or object.  The scope of interaction is continuously evolving - even the realm of grocery store shopping has changed drastically in the last 20 years.

HCI describes a specific field of interaction between humans and a digital computing machine. The more colloquial term for this category is UX. Today, it is an enormously important factor in successful tech businesses - if users feel negatively about your software, your business won't attract a user base, and you won't get any funding.

UX is the totality of the effects felt by the user vefore, during, and after interacting with a product or system in an ecology. The way that a user "feels" about an interaction with a computer can have a number of influencing sub-factors: physical interface, utility, meaningfulness, and emotional impact.

UX is often congregated with the design of user interface (UI); however, these are separate concepts. While both UX and UI heavily involve designing the interaction between the computer and the user, UX is more focused on the design of the interaction, rather than the design of the interface between the user and the computer. In short, designing UX looks at the attributes of the interaction that will occur, and designing UI looks at how that interaction is implemented.
