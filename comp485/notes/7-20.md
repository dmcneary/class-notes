## Prelude of Process Chapters

### UX design spaces
Real UX designers have a dedicated design studio in which they may become immersed in their work. This provides a space for co-location, collaboration, and an environment which lends to tackling design problems. Studios are used to analyze and discuss usage research, build and display data models, and externalize design ideas.

It's important for a space to be dedicated, not temporary, and have ample room for design artifacts, drawings, posters, etc. Comfortability is another big factor, and workspaces must be ergonomic and spacious.

### UX team roles
There are many responsibilities in a UX team. Key roles include:
- Usage Researchers
- UX Designers
- Graphic/Visual Designers
- UX Analysts

As well, a team may be managed by a Product Owner. This person is responsible for the success of the product. The owner makes sure that the product is on track with the vision and business goals, as well as making sure that the design process is followed. Owners are closer to the user or client, and is in charge of creating product concepts, user stories, and spirnt plans. They are also the main point of communication for clients, marketing, and engineering.

### Creating UX projects
A project is initiated by a marketing strategy, management edict, product sponsor, system client, inventive ideas, or perceived needs to improve an existing product or system. The commission for the project usually comes from the upper echelons of a business, and not from the team itself. It begins with some type of document, typically a contract or brief proposal. The UX team is responsible for filling in gaps of definition of desired capabilities. These desires are usually presented in a concept statement called a Statement of Work. Often, the lifecycle activities pursued in meeting these desired capabilities overlap and are iterated upon as necessary. This is where the Wheel UX process comes into play.

#### Understanding Needs
The goal of this lifestyle activity is to understand the business domain, users, work practice, usage scenarios, and the subject-matter domain. This step is usually done in the context of some kind of usage research.
Textbook chapters:
- Chapter 7: Usage research data elicitation (Contextual inquiry)
- Chapter 8: Usage research data analysis (Contextual analysis)  
- Chapter 9: Data modeling (Representations of important aspects to inform immersion and design)  
- Chapter 10: Requirements extraction

#### Design Concepts
The goal of this step is to create designs as candidate solutions. We start with ideation and sketching to create design candidates, generate design framings, low-fidelity prototyping, and rapid evaluation for design exploration
• Chapter 14: Design  
creation  
• Ideation and sketching to  
create design  
candidates, generate  
design framings, low-  
fidelity prototyping, rapid  
evaluation for design  
exploration
Chapter 15: Conceptual design: Mental  
models, system models, storyboards  
• Design to convey designer’s system model  
to users  
• So they can form a correct mental model  
of how product/system works
Intermediate design: Illustrated scenarios,  
wireframes, medium fidelity mockups of  
design forerunners  
• Design production: Specify detailed design  
plans for implementation of the emerging  
design choice  
• High-fidelity visual comps (pixel perfect  
screen designs)
Content targets of intermediate design and  
design production  
• Chapter 16: Designing the ecology and  
pervasive information architecture  
• Chapter 17: Designing the interaction  
• Chapter 18: Designing for emotional impact

Broad interpretation of the  
term “Design”  
• UX design  
encompasses the  
whole UX lifecycle  
process (everything  
we do in UX is to  
produce a design)

Narrow interpretation of  
the term “design”  
• UX design is also just  
the lifecycle activity for  
design creation  
• The Design Solutions  
box within the overall  
UX design lifecycle  
• The creative human  
activity in which new  
ideas are  
synthesized and put  
together

Need both interpretations of  
the term “Design”  
• Both ways of using the term are useful, but  
we lack the vocabulary to distinguish them  
• Usually meaning will be obvious from context
Prototype Candidates  
lifecycle activity • Chapter 20: Prototype  
Candidates  
• To realize and envision  
promising design  
candidates  
• Create representations  
of design to required  
fidelity  
• Like sketching, often  
done in parallel with  
design

## Usage Research - Data Elicitation
Usage Research begins with eliciting data. This is also known as contextual inquiry; essentially, these are fancy terms for figuring out what the project is all about. The UX designer must understand the client's practice of their work, and be able to suggest improvements in the design (or complete redesigns of the work methodology). This is not simply gathering requirements, or asking users what they want. It requires thinking about the user's work in its context - how work is performed, where it happens, and what the goals of the work are.
