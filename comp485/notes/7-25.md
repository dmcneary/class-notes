## UX Design Requirements: User Stories and Requirement Statements
The final sub-activity in the Understand Needs lifecycle activity, this step is where UX wants and needs are codified for design. User stories are the de facto standard for representing UX design reqs. In usage research elicitation, one category of data was inputs to user stories. 

A user story is a brief narra in voice of user work role stating need for capability, or a wanted feature, and why.

User stories are prioritized by client business needs. Also, stories should be prioritized to deliver an MVP for each iteration of the Wheel.

Formal UX requirements statements are rarely needed, except for high domain complexity in the system perspective, high need for rigor, compliance constraints, contractual obligations, etc. Composing a formal requirements statement is an involved process - despite decades of study in academia, the focus on requirements in both SE and UX is fading. Detailed formal requirements statements cannot ever be 'complete' nor '100% correct' since requirements are almost always guaranteed to change throughout the lifecycle. Nonetheless, formal requirements can be extracted from usage research data analysis.
