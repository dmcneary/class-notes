## Lab Questions
1. Using formula 4.5 and "percent difference" formula to calculate percent uncertainty:
a. $x = 10 \pm 0.1\text{ cm}$:  
$$100\Bigg[\frac{\vert40.1\frac{100}{(100-9.9)^2} - 39.9\frac{100}{(100-10.1)^2}\vert}{\frac{40.1\frac{100}{(100-9.9)^2} + 39.9\frac{100}{(100-10.1)^2}}{2}}\Bigg] = 0.56\%$$
b. $x = 50 \pm 0.1\text{ cm}$
$$100\Bigg[\frac{\vert0.1\frac{100}{(100-49.9)^2} - 0.1\frac{100}{(100-50.1)^2}\vert}{\frac{0.1\frac{100}{(100-49.9)^2} + 0.1\frac{100}{(100-50.1)^2}}{2}}\Bigg] = 0.80\%$$
c. $x = 95 \pm 0.1\text{ cm}$
$$100\Bigg[\frac{\vert45.1\frac{100}{(100-94.9)^2} - 44.9\frac{100}{(100-95.1)^2}\vert}{\frac{45.1\frac{100}{(100-94.9)^2} + 44.9\frac{100}{(100-95.1)^2}}{2}}\Bigg] = 7.55\%$$

2. If the 2 volts from the power supply were to be increased to 6 volts, I would expect the galvanometer to be much more sensitive to minute movements in the position of the "split" of the wire of the potentiometer ($x$ vs $100-x$), since given the same amount of resistance from the components of the circuit, there would be more current flowing (following from Ohm's Law). Since the galvanometer reads in &micro;A, we would need to be careful in using the "K-key" to increase the accuracy of the reading. to avoid overloading the galvanometer. I might also expect the wire of the potentiometer to get quite hot.

3. Depressing the K-key of the galvanometer greatly increased the precision of the reading once we were in the "ballpark" of a good $x-$value for an accurate reading. However, this increased sensitivity provided some concern when the distance to a proper $x$ was increased, as the instrument is apparently quite vulnerable to current in an "unbalanced" circuit.

4. Fluctuations in the voltage provided by the power supply will result in a fluctuating current reading from the galvanometer, and will make it harder to pinpoint a "balance" point for the $x-$position of the right and left sides of the split potentiometer resistance.

5. The contact point should be moved towards the right, decreasing the $x$ distance.

6. The measured and observed values for $R_2$ are quite close, and the percent difference is quite small:
$$ 100\Bigg[\frac{\vert25\Omega - 28.4\Omega\vert}{\frac{25\Omega + 28.4\Omega}{2}}\Bigg] = 8.7\%$$<br />
However, the results from observed vs. direct measurements of $R_1$ are inconclusive, given the large percent of error:
$$ 100\Bigg[\frac{\vert30\Omega - 59.8\Omega\vert}{\frac{30\Omega + 59.8\Omega}{2}}\Bigg] = 66\%$$
