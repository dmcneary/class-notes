# Chapter 21: Electric Charge and Electric Field
September 1, 2021

## Review
Charged particles interact with one another depending on their charge - opposites attract

Coulomb's Law allows us to calc the mag of the force that they exert on each other

Fe = k * |q1q2|/r^2

K_e = 8.99 x 10^9 Nm^2/C^2 ~~ 9

The direction of the force depends on the configuration of the charges. The forces between two charges is always directed along the radial line between them.

## Example
Two 1.0 kg masses are 1.0 m apart on a frictionless table. Each has +1.0 &micro;C of charge.

a. What is the magnitude of the electrical force on one of the masses?  
b. What is the initial acceleration of each mass if they are released and allowed to move?

### Solution
a. vec F = k * |q_1 * q_2 | / m^2

= k * |1.0 &micro;C * 1.0 &micro;C| / 1.0kg ^ 2

b. vec a_x = sum vec Fx/m = 9x10^-3 N i/1kg
=9.0 x 10^-3 m/s^2 i
