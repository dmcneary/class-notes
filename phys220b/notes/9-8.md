# Chapter 21: Electric Charge and Electric Field
September 1, 2021

## Review
Charged particles interact with one another depending on their charge - opposites attract

Coulomb's Law allows us to calc the mag of the force that they exert on each other

Fe = k * |q1q2|/r^2

K_e = 8.99 x 10^9 Nm^2/C^2 ~~ 9

The direction of the force depends on the configuration of the charges. The forces between two charges is always directed along the radial line between them.

## Example
Two 1.0 kg masses are 1.0 m apart on a frictionless table. Each has +1.0 &micro;C of charge.

a. What is the magnitude of the electrical force on one of the masses?  
b. What is the initial acceleration of each mass if they are released and allowed to move?

### Solution
a. $$\vec{F} = k\frac{\vert q_1q_2 \vert}{r^2} \\
 = k\frac{\vert1.0 \mu\text{C} * 1.0 \mu\text{C}\vert}{1.0 \text{ kg}^2} \\
= k \frac{\vert1.0 \mu\text{C} * 1.0 \mu\text{C}\vert}{1.0 \text{ kg} ^ 2} \\
\approx 0.009$$ 

b. $$\vec{a_x} = \sum\frac{\vec{F_x}}{m} \\
= \frac{9 * 10^{-3}\text{ N}}{1.0\text{ kg}}\hat{i} \\
= 9.0 * 10^{-3} \frac{\text{m}}{\text{s}^2}\hat{i}$$
