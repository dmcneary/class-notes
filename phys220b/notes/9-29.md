# Electric Potential Energy cont.
September 29, 2021

How can we relate the work done on a particle by an electric field, and the potential energy of the particle? To review, work done by a conservative force "converts" energy from one "type" to another:

$$W_c = -\Delta U = U_a - U_b = \int_a^b \vec{F}\cdot d\vec{r}$$

If the force is constant, we can simply factor out the force from the integral and integrate the path taken. However, because the electric field, and thus the electric force, varies depending on the distance from the charge, we must integrate force as well:

$$W_e = \int^b_a \vec{F_e}\cdot d\vec{r} = \int^{r_b}_{r_a}\frac{kqq_0}{r^2}dr = kqq_0\int^{r_b}_{r_a}\frac{1}{r^2} dr = kqq_0\frac{-1}{r}\vert^{r_b}_{r_a} = \frac{kqq_0}{r_a} - \frac{kqq_0}{r_b}$$

So, the electric potential energy of two point charges only depends on the distance between them:

$$U = \frac{1}{4\pi\epsilon_0}\frac{qq_0}{r} $$

Potential energy is defined to be zero when the charges are infinitely far apart (1/r = 1/infinity). If two charges have the same sign, then electric potential energy is positive and goes to 0 as the distance between them increases; for two opposite sign charges, the electric potential energy is negative and goes to 0 as they get closer together.

Potential energy is a scalar, calculating the net potential energy is simply an algebraic sum. For instance, with multiple charges:

$$U_{q_0, q_1, ..., q_i} = \frac{q_0}{4\pi\epsilon_0}\sum_i \frac{q_i}{r_i}$$
